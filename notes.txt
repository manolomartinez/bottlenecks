Dretske has two goals for information: show how it can be quantified, and show
how information can be at the basis of representations, knowledge, etc. (in the
beginning there was information)

Shannon: from "A" mathematical theory of communication to "The" mathematical
theory of communication

Kalkman -- Information, influence...
    p. 6: "information is probably not something the organism itself thinks
    about"

    p. 20: "Receivers display plasticity in their responses to signals: they
    are not necessarily subject to the whim of senders. Thus, ‘Information’
    essentially becomes short-hand for a view of communication in which sender
    influence is balanced by receiver flexibility."

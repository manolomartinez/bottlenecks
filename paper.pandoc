% Representations as Rate-Distortion Sweet Spots

# Introduction

Claude E. Shannon's "A Mathematical Theory of Communication", the astonishing
paper in which he lays the foundations of information theory, was first
published in 1948, and subsequently republished in book form in 1949 as "The
Mathematical Theory of Communication". In their foreword to the 50th
anniversary edition of this book Blahut and Hajek remark that this change in
title is "both trivial and profound" [@ShannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1998, p. vii]. It
is profound indeed: in one year it had become apparent to Shannon that his was
not just a possible theoretical approach but, quite simply, *the* theory of
information.

The study of information is essential to a number of philosophical programs. In
particular, unsurprisingly, it is widely seen as essential to the study of
communication and mental representation. Yet philosophers working on these
programs often take themswelves not to be centrally concerned with "Shannon
information", as it is often put. This perception is wrong. Shannon's theory of
information is *the* theory of information. 

I intend to make good on this last assertion by canvassing a fully (Shannon)
informational derivation of the representational content of brain vehicles, in
a certain paradigmatic situation. This description will show how a number of
apparently disparate threads in the literature on naturalistic metasemantics
actually belong in the same coherent picture. Among these threads, first, the
claim, advanced by Sterelny, Burge, and Rescorle among others that
representation is to be distinguished from mere information transduction by the
former holding a many-to-one relation to inputs, and a one-to-many relation to
outputs (in a sense to be explained below). A second thread is the claim that
natural kinds, and other "reference magnets"  are by-default preferable as
candidates to figure in the content of simple representations (Sterelny, Lewis,
Sider). A third thread is the supposed inability of informational accounts to
account for misrepresentation, and therefore the supposed need to distinguish
between natural and non-natural information (Scarantino, Birch, Neander). In
all three threads the transition from mere information processing to
representation is thought to be mediated by the addition of further conditions:
architectural constraints in the first thread; metaphysical constraints on the
represented world, in the second thread; combination of different,
extra-informational solutions have been tried for the third. In what follows I
show that these different extra-informational ideas in fact fall out of a
sufficiently expressive information-theoretic description model of
representation. 

Most (I am tempted to say, all)  philosophical discussion of
information-theoretic ideas is a reaction to two seminal bodies of work. On the
one hand Dretske's [-@DretskeKnowledgelowInformation1981] and
[-@DretskeExplainingBehaviorReasons1988] presentations. On the other hand,
Brian Skyrms' evolutionary game-theoretic *sender-receiver models*
[-@SkyrmsSignalsEvolutionLearning2010]. Both traditions simplify
information-theoretic models in the same key respects. They model the world as
a set of mutually exclusive, jointly exhaustive states. This makes the models
oblivious to the *internal structure* of world states, how property
instantiations in these states are related with one another, and with what
happens when the world is in other states. The consequence of this is that
several features of the communicative arrangements that are, I submit, key to
understanding what we mean by representations---the sweet spots and bottlenecks
of the title to this piece---are glossed over in those models. 

In what follows I describe communication models in which the world that is
represented consists on sets of properties---world states will consist on
instantiations of properties in the set, and these instantiations will
typically be probabilistically dependent on one another in various ways. In
these models sender and receiver communicate over a channel that is not wide
enough (i.e., has not enough *rate*) to communicate without residue everything
that is the case in the world at any given time---there is a bottleneck, as
there always is. There is a cost, usually called *distortion*, associated to
the information that is lost in communication, and it is possible to calculate
a *rate-distortion* function [@ShannonMathematicalTheoryCommunication1948;
@ShannonCodingtheoremsdiscrete1959; @CoverElementsInformationTheory2006, ch.
10] that tells how much rate is necessary to achieve a certain level of
distortion. The main claim of this paper is that much in our
representation-attributing practices is sensitive to information structure that
is glossed over in traditional Dretskean analyses, and brought out by
rate-distortion analyses. More specifically: a first condition on messages in a
sender-receiver arrangement to count as representations is that nhere be a
rate-distortion *sweet spot* in the arrangement. a rate such that, once you
reach it, increasing it brings much less reduction in distortion than it did
before hitting the sweet spot. The sweet-spot rate offers an (objectively)
optimal compromise between channel width and distortion.

Now, the fact that the rate distortion curve shows sweet spots does not depend
on the strategy by which the sender encodes its signal, or by how the receiver
decodes it. It's a function of both the way the world is and of the distortion
measure---which describes what it is that senders and receivers value, what it
is more or less important for them not to miss about the world state. That is:
the world and the interests of the agent jointly create a rate-distortion
problem. It's still an open question whether sender and receiver are solving
this problem optimally. The second condition on the presence of representations
is precisely this: whether sender and receiver follow an encoding and decoding
strategy that lands them at the rate-distortion sweet spot. When they do, their
signaling behavior acts in effect as an efficient compression scheme of the
world state. Furthermore, the encoding-decoding strategy at the sweet spot
fixes how it is that signals *take* the world to be---what the content of those
representations is.

This was a very quick first pass on the ideas to be developed in what follows,
but we can already see how the rate-distortion approach offers a variety of
explanatory advantages as compared to other traditional information-theoretic
approaches: 

First, identifying representations with messages exchanged in the vicinity of a
rate-distortion sweet spot has the consequence that representations are part of
a very efficient, lossy compression scheme. This says much more than how the
conditional probabilities of world states change with the tokening of messages
(which is, at bottom, the piece of information Dretskean approaches focus on).
It embeds this information on the wider context of the probabilistic structure
of the environment where these representations happens, and of those aspects of
the environment that are relevant to sender and receiver. These representations
naturally accommodate misrepresentation.

Second, it provides insight on which kinds of situations are most accommodating
to the emergence of representations---it will turn out that at least one
prominent situation in which rate-distortion sweet spots arise is when the
world is populated by probabilistic structures of properties which can
plausibly be taken to be natural kinds.

Third, it offers an information-theoretic explanation of the popular idea that
information-carrying states are only representations when they are produced in
a variety of different circumstances (@BurgeOriginsobjectivity2010's perceptual
constancy and @SterelnyThoughtHostileWorld2003's robust XXX are variations of
the same idea) and when they are relevant to a range of different action plans
or purposes [@SterelnyBasicMinds1995's *broad-banded response*]. We will see
that these conditions are just ways in which a rate-distortion sweet spot can
be created.

# Information in the Sender-Receiver Framework

The topic of this paper is how representations are related to information. In
recent philosophical discussions this question is usually (I'm tempted to say,
universally) framed as the following two-step process: 

Fixing Information: 

: we first focus on a certain vehicle, M, and try to ascertain what states of
affairs it carries information about---there will typically be a lot of
those---and how to quantify this information.

From Information to Content:

: We then try to formulate additional conditions for one (or more) of these
states of affairs to count as the content of M. Possibly, if it does not meet
those additional conditions, we will conclude that M, even if it carries
information about the world, is not a representation.

The first step has given rise to a few different accounts of what it takes for
vehicles such as M to carry information about the world. The common theme in
these accounts is that a vehicle carrying information about a state of affairs
corresponds to *ocurrences of the vehicle making a probabilistic difference to
occurrences of the state* [@ScarantinoInformationprobabilisticdifference2015;
@StegmannUlrichProspectsProbabilisticTheories2015;
@SkyrmsSignalsEvolutionLearning2010;
@Godfrey-SmithSignalsEvolutionLearning2011; @SheaConsumersNeedInformation2007,
the label is Scarantino's].^[Millikan's account in XXX is superficially
non-probabilistic...] 

To make this idea more precise, let me introduce a simple model of what a
probablistic difference amounts to in this case: we introduce a *random
variable*, S, that will encode the state of the world. For my current purposes,
a random variable can be identified with a set of possible states for the
variable to be in, $\{S_1, \dots, S_i, \dots, S_n\}$, together with the
probabilities for each state $\{P_1, \dots, P_i, \dots, P_n\}$, where $P_i\geq
0$ and $\sum_i P_i = 1$ [@MacKayInformationtheoryinference2003, p. 34]. 

We introduce another random variable for vehicles: there are, say, $m$ possible
*messages* (that's the name I'll settle in for putatively representational
vehicles) $\{M_1, \dots, M_i, \dots, M_m\}$, with probabilities $\{P_1, \dots,
P_i, \dots, P_m\}$.  Now, in order to calculate whether a certain message $M_i$
and a certain world state $S_j$ are independent we need to know their *joint
probability*, $P(S=S_i; M=M_j)$. (For simplicity, from now on, instead of
$P(S=S_i)$ I will just write $P(S_i)$, *mutatis mutandis* for all analogous
expressions.) 

We can give joint probabilities for every combination of message and state
using an $n\times m$ matrix:

$$\begin{bmatrix}
    P(S_1; M_1) & \dots  & P(S_1; M_m) \\
    \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    P(S_n; M_n) & \dots  & P(S_n; M_m)
\end{bmatrix}$$

The unconditional probabilities of states can be calculated by summing over
rows: $P(S_i) = \sum_j P(S_i; M_j)$.[^unconditional] Analogously, the
unconditional probabilities of messages can be calculated by summing over
columns: $P(M_i) = \sum_j P(S_j; M_i)$.  The probability of a certain state
*conditional on* a certain message is calculated as follows:

$$P(S_i | M_j) = P(S_i;M_j)/P(M_j)$$

[^unconditional]: That is, the unconditional probability of state $S_i$ is just
the probability that $S_i$ and $M_1$ jointly happen, or $S_i$ and $M_2$ jointly
happen, or... etc., for all messages. 
    
    Incidentally, unconditional probabilities are also called *marginal*
    probabilities because they are (or were) usually written as the sum, at the
    margin of the matrix.

Now, the probabilistic-difference condition of information-carrying alluded to
above can be given the following simple expression; a message $M_j$ makes a
probabilistic difference to the instantiation of a state $S_i$ iff the
following *basic inequality* holds: 

$$P(S_i|M_j) \neq P(S_i)$$ 

Nearly all the accounts of information developed in the recent philosophical
literature on this topic are variations on, and attempts to quantify, this
inequality. A few examples follow.^[In the examples I have modified notation to
align it with the one I have been using. Some of the theories summarized below
also introduce a term $k$ that stands for the knowledge state of the receiver
of the message. This term makes no difference to the discussion that follows
(except in the respect discussed in fn. XXX) and I will ignore it in what
follows.]

The foundational account of information in the philosophy of mind is
@DretskeKnowledgelowInformation1981. According to Dretske, a message $M$ carries the
information that $S$ obtains iff $P(S|M) = 1 > P(S)$. That is, Dretske demands
that the basic inequality holds and, moreover, that tokenings of $M$ make $S$
certain. 

Shea drops the certainty requirement: a message $M_j$ carries the correlational
information that $S_i$ obtains iff $P(S_i|M_j) > P(S_i|\neg M_j)$. This
condition is equivalent to the basic inequality, $P(S_i|M_j) > P(S_i)$
[-@SheaConsumersNeedInformation2007, p. 421].[^not-by-chance] 

[^not-by-chance]: In many of the other proposals in this quick review, a
not-by-chance condition is imposed on information. In Shea, for example, the
inequality in the main text must hold "... for a common natural reason within
some spatio-temporal domain D". In the models I will be discussing in the
sequel part of this sort of condition is met by default: I, will be assuming an
objective, broadly propensity-based understanding of probability statements:
they are objective because they do not just record the epistemic state of an
agent; and they are broadly propensity-based because they do not just summarize
actual runs (in our case, in  actual rate of coincidence of message and state
of affairs), but rather describe the tendency of that kind of situation to give
rise to such frequencies, if repeated. As such, coincidence by chance is ruled
out as not giving rise to the relevant kind of probabilistic connection. 

    This takes care of the condition that there should be a reason for the
    relevant inequality to hold (of course, assuming that a propensity-based
    account of objective chances can be made to work.) But Shea claims that the
    reason in question should be *one*. This is precisely the kind of condition
    that can be investigated by using the probabilistic models of the world I
    will favor in the sequel---although I will not discuss it in this paper.
    For my current purposes, it will do simply to assume that the condition is
    met. The problems I will identify with current accounts of information do
    not depend on this.


In Skyrms [-@SkyrmsSignalsEvolutionLearning2010, p. 36] the "information in
[$M_j$] in favor of [$S_i$]" is defined as the *pointwise mutual information*
[pmi henceforth, references to this label] between state and message:
$\log\frac{P(S_i | M_j)}{P(S_i)}$. The pmi is nonzero iff the basic inequality
is true, but it also quantifies the amount of information (i.e., the distance
between conditional and unconditional state probabilities) as the distance of
the pmi from zero. 

@Godfrey-SmithSignalsEvolutionLearning2011 points out that sometimes we are
mainly interested, not in the difference of conditional and unconditional state
probabilities, but in the actual probability of the state given that, as a
matter of fact, the message has been produced. I.e., $P(S_i | M_j)$. 

@ScarantinoInformationprobabilisticdifference2015 calls this latter number the
*degree of overall support*, and takes the ecumenical route of including both
the pmi *and* the degree of overall support as the informational content of
signals in his *probabilistic difference maker theory*  (*op. cit.* p. 429). 

The running thread uniting these prominent contemporary accounts of
information is that all there is to Shannon's information theory, at least for
the purposes of investigating the nature of representation, is two quantities:
the unconditional probability of states and the probability of states
conditional on messages, perhaps rearranged as the logarithm of their ratio, or
in some other way. It is not terribly surprising that it is routinely concluded
that there is much more to representation than information: the above
inequalities and quantities are commonly presented as signaling the presence
of, or measuring, *natural* (sometimes, alternatively, *correlational*)
information, and representation is taken to depend on (or perhaps be more or
less coextensional with) the presence of *non-natural* information. 

Having representational status is certainly not the same as carrying
information, and representational content is certainly not the same as
information. On the other hand, understanding information theory the way most
philosophers currently do (i.e., as exhausted by answers to the question
whether certain entities carry information about other entities; answers,
moreover, that should be given in terms of something like the basic inequality)
is unhelpful. There is much more to information theory that can be leveraged to
improve our understanding of representations. 

I will substantiate this claim in section 4 but, before that, I need to review
some of the proposal that have been made as to ways to bridge the gap between
information and representation. I will argue that most of these ways,
apparently non information-theoretic, can in fact be fruitfully regarded as
attempts to identify a cluster of yet more (Shannon) informational properties.

# Bridging natural and nonnatural 

A quick recap: most everyone agrees that information is important to
representation but, the dominant understanding of information being what it is,
most everyone agrees as well that information must be supplemented with
extra-informational properties if it is to amount to representational content.
There are a few reasons why information-carrying alone is usually deemed
insufficient for representational status.

First, it is sometimes assumed in philosophy that information, in the
understanding spelled out in the previous section, must be always true. For
example, @NeanderMarkMentalDefense2017, p. 6, distinguishes information in a
"natural-factive" sense from information in a "fully intentional" sense, and
claims that "natural-factive information is factive because nothing can ...
carry the information that some state of affairs, P, is the case, unless P is
in fact the case" (*op. cit.*, p. 7)

A dissenting voice here is @SkyrmsSignalsEvolutionLearning2010, ch. 3, who
offers his notion of informational content, reviewed above, as "a
generalization of standard philosophical notions of propositional content".
Consider again the random variable, $S$, that represents the world. We can
calculate the information that a certain message $M_i$ carries in favor of all
world states $S_j$. This results in an *informational content* vector:

$$\langle\log_2 p(S_1 | M_i) - \log_2 p(S_1), \ldots, \log_2 p(S_n | M_i) -
\log_2 p(S_n)\rangle$$

According to Skyrms, the standard philosophical notion of content should be
identified with those world states $S_j$ which the message does not rule
out---i.e., those for which $p(S_j | M_i) > 0$. This corresponds to
non-infinite entries in the informational-content vector (because the logarithm
of zero is minus infinity.) So, if the only states not ruled out by $M_i$ are,
say, $S_1$ and $S_2$, then $M_i$ has the propositional content that $S_1$ or
$S_2$ is the case. As @BirchPropositionalcontentsignalling2014 has pointed out, though, such
Skyrmsian propositional contents have the fatal flaw that they cannot be false: 

First, $S_j$ is part of the content of $M_i$ if and only if $M_i$ does not rule
out $S_j$. 

But $M_i$ will be false only if it is produced in a world state which is not
part of its content. 

So, for it to be false, it has to be produced in a state which it rules out,
that is, a state $S_k$ such that $p(S_k | M_i) = 0$. A consequence of this is
that, if $p(M_i) > 0$ (that is, if the message can be produced at all) then
$p(M_i | S_k)$ is also zero.^[This is just an application of Bayes theorem:
$p(A|B) = \frac{p(B|A)p(A)}{p(B)}$.] That is, it is impossible for the message
to be produced in a state in which it would be false.

Representational content, then, cannot be just a special case of informational
content. The usual way in which this point is made is with a nod to Grice's
[-@GriceMeaning1957, p. 378] distinction between "natural" and "nonnatural"
meaning. Natural meaning is the relation that holds, e.g., between smoke and
fire, or spots and measles. Nonnatural meaning holds, e.g., between sentences
and the propositions they express. Grice (*op. cit*, p. 379) leaves openthe
possibility of giving an account of nonnatural meaning in terms of natural
meaning---although this is not his own project. This is the kind of account
that contemporary naturalistic metasemanticists see themselves as engaging in
(Scarantino, Neander).

In what follows I will consider a couple of ideas which have been floated as to
ways to construct nonnatural meanings out of natural ones. My aim is not to
argue against them. I think they are on the right track. My claim will rather
be that a better informed understanding of Shannon's information theory
provides a way to incorporating these insights in a unified, purely
informational account of representation.

## Many-to-one-to-many Architectures

The first proposal has to do with *architectural* constraints on
representational vehicles. The idea is that it is not enough that these
vehicles carry information, in any of the closely related senses discussed
above; on top of that, they must sit in the right place in a certain cognitive
architecture. There are a few proposals along these lines.

@SterelnyThoughtHostileWorld2003, for example, has argued that talk of
representation has a place only when the cognitive system that has them
functionally distinguishes belief-like state from goal-like states---when
representations are, in his favored teminology, *decoupled*. Sterelny suggests
that decoupling is enabled by two prior evolutionary transitions: from
"detection" to "robust tracking", on the one hand; and from "narrow-banded" to
"broad-banded". Detection systems, for Sterelny, are just single-cued
discriminatory mechanisms
(p. 26): there is one single feature of the environment detection systems are
attuned to, via a single cue. Single-cue detection works very well when the
environment is "transparent"---i.e., when it cooperates, there being high
correlation between a property relevant to the agent's fitness and a cue
the agent can detect. But environments are often "translucent": "there is a
complex relationship between the incoming stimuli that the organism can
detect and the features of relevance to it" [@SterelnyThoughtHostileWorld2003, p.
78]. In those cases, it pays for cognitive agents to develop *broad-banded*
detection systems, which are able to zero in on whatever is
fitness-relevant throughout changes in the properties actually detected by
the sensory apparatus. Broad-banded detection is in essence a *many-to-one*
relation between input and representational vehicle: different inputs give
rise to the same representation. 

The other property that @SterelnyThoughtHostileWorld2003 proposes as a mark of
representational status is what he calls *response breadth*
[@SterelnyThoughtHostileWorld2003, p. 90]: the idea here is that a single
representation will give rise to different courses of action, depending on the
context (that may include other mental states of the agent). Response breadth
is in essence a *one-to-many* relation between representational vehicle and
output: same representation gives rise to different agential outputs.

Other theorists have advocated similar architectural constraints on
representational vehicles. Famously, @BurgeOriginsobjectivity2010 places a
great deal of weight on *perceptual constancies* in his characterization of
perceptual representation: "in a rough, non-criterial way, perceptual
constancies are necessary as well as sufficient for ... perceptual
representation." [@BurgeOriginsobjectivity2010, p. 413.]^[The "rough, non-criterial"
qualifiers are important: Burge nowhere claims that perceptual representation
is just information plus constancies, even if this is the impression one gets
from many secondary sources [see, e.g., @CampbellOriginsObjectivity2011]. In
any event, constancies are undoubtedly central to his account of
representation. In other theorists, such as
@SchultePerceptualrepresentationsteleosemantic2015, the role of constancies as
a sufficient condition on perceptual representations is more clear-cut.] These
constancies are "the perceptual analog of Fregean informative identities. A
given perceptual representatum (kind, property, relation, or particular) is
represented as that representatum, even as it is presented in different ways,
from different perceptual perspectives. These differences in perspective and
representational content, or perceptual mode of presentation, are caused by
variations in sensory registration of proximal stimulation."
[@BurgeOriginsobjectivity2010, p. 411.] This is clearly a variation on
Sterelny's broad-banded detection and, as such, a many-to-one architectural
constraint on representational status.

Constancies are typically presented [in @BurgeOriginsobjectivity2010; but also,
e.g., @SchultePerceptualrepresentationsteleosemantic2015; or
@RescorlaMillikanhoneybeenavigation2013] as helping overcome the extreme
liberality of naturalistic accounts of representation. Rescorla, for example,
remarks that "[t]ruth-conditions [i.e., representations---MM] must earn their
explanatory keep" [@RescorlaMillikanhoneybeenavigation2013, p. 93] and argues
that, while the postulation of representations is warranted in vision science,
precisely because of many-to-one facts such as "the visual system [deploying]
various cues ... to estimate that a perceived object has a certain depth" [op.
cit., p. 92; original emphasis suppressed] things are less clear for other
vehicles (such as, e.g., signals exchanged by bacteria) that are typically
credited with representational content in the literature on naturalistic
metasemantics. It is less clear why many-to-one structures should aid to the
representational status of the target vehicle. What's 

## Reference Magnetism

A second important idea in the program of deriving non-natural meaning from
natural meaning is to focus on the entities that should figure in the content
of simple representations. The suggestion, typically, is that represented
entities should belong to natural, or real, kinds.  For example, Dan Ryder
[-@RyderSINBADNeurosemanticsTheory2004; -@RyderThinkingKinds2006] has argued
that in what he calls the SINBAD^[This acronym stands for Set of INteracting
BAckpropagating Dendrites" [@RyderSINBADNeurosemanticsTheory2004; p. 212].]
model of the cortex, neurons become attuned to *sources of correlation*. These
entities are closely related to Richard Boyd's *homeostatic property clusters*
[also HPC henceforth],^[First presented in his [-@BoydWhatRealismImplies1989];
see also -@BoydHomeostasisSpeciesHigher1999;
@ChakravarttyMetaphysicsScientificRealism2007;
@KornblithInductiveInferenceits1993; @MagnusScientificenquirynatural2012, among
many others.] HPC theory, one of the main naturalistic accounts of natural
kinds, identifies such kinds with clusters of properties which tend to be
instantiated together, and such that this frequent co-instantiation is not just
a statistical fluke---these clusters (the HPCs in question), at least in some
cases, are the target of our natural-kind terms. What Ryder calls sources of
correlation are the grounds for these HPC-related frequent
co-instantiations---whatever it is that makes them *not* statistical
flukes.^[It should be pointed that it is compatible with Boyd's original
formulation that there be no clear grounds of correlation: according to Boyd
perhaps it's just that the instantiation of some properties make the
instantiation of other properties more likely and the whole cluster pulls
itself up by its bootstraps [see @BoydWhatRealismImplies1989, p. 16]. These
complications need not detain us here.] According to Ryder, cortical processing
in the brain is uniquely suited to the identification and prediction of these
sources of correlation. Ryder suggests that many of the representations the
brain trades target sources of correlation.
@MartinezTeleosemanticsIndeterminacy2013 and Artiga (manuscript) have made more
general cases that simple representations preferably target Boydian HPCs, or
related entities. In all three cases, the account is, implicitly or explicitly,
presented as a way to solve the indeterminacy problem for naturalistic
metasemantic accounts.

A very similar idea has been proposed in what is, as far as I am aware, a
totally independent line of enquiry starting with @LewisNewworktheory1983 and
@LewisPutnamparadox1984: "among the countless tinhgs and classes there are ...
[o]nly an elite minority are carved at the joints, so that their boundaries are
established by objetive sameness and difference in nature. Only these elite
things and classes are eligible to serve as referents"
[@LewisPutnamparadox1984, p. 227]. According to Sider
[-@SiderWritingBookWorld2014, p. 33] the claim that this *reference magnetism*
"solves the problem of radical semantic underdetermination, is a consequence of
a more general claim that explanatory theories must be stated in joint-carving
terms." (Sider, *op. cit.*)

It's interesting to note that both the appeal to many-to-one-to-many
architectures and reference magnetism are defended on explanatory grounds. As
we have seen, according to Burge and others, the presence of constancies makes
the appeal to representations explanatorily fruitful. According to Sider
reference magnetism is just an example of the general rule according to which
only "joint-carving terms" should figure in explanations. It is considerably
less clear in just which way the aforementioned explanatory virtues are related
to the representational status of this or that vehicle. Why these virtues in
particular? And why representational status in particular? And, of course,
nothing at all is said about how, or whether, those two ideas are related. Is
reference magnetism made necessary by many-to-one-to-many architectures? Vice
versa? Both by a third different thing? Are they unrelated constraints on
representational vehicles and their content?

As we are about to see, these two ideas are indeed related. In order to see how
we need to step up our information-theoretic game. 

# Information Theory is a Source-Channel Theory

As we saw in section 2, philosophy has understdood information theory as a
mostly definitional effort: at least for all philosophers of mind have
typically cared, the theory begins and end with a presentation of what it takes
for one random variable (or the worldly feature it stands for) to carry
information about another. This is, in all likelihood, a result of the immense
influence that Dretske's 1981 book has had in shaping the philosopher's
conception of information theory. But information theory is, emphatically, not
a definitional effort. It is, well, a *theory*, and as such it is chiefly
composed of claims that are proposed as true about the world. 

In a nutshell, the most celebrated results in information theory have to do
with how faithful transmission over a channel can be, as a function of the
capacity of the channel in question. These results have played absolutely no
role in informational accounts of representation. I will presently defend that
they are, in fact, central to understanding in which way representation is
connected to information. Take the idealized representation of an
information-processing pipeline in fig 1.

![An information-processing pipeline](graphviz/infotheory.pdf)

Here an *encoder* produces a signal as a response to information incoming from
a source. This signal goes through a channel and is subsequently decoded,
producing a message that is then utilized for whatever relevant purposes
downstream.

![The information-processing pipeline in the Dretskean tradition](graphviz/info_for_philosophers.pdf)

The first thing to note is that the philosopher's notions introduced above only
have use for the first two links in the information-processing chain: how
signals carry information about a certain original message produced by a
source, as depicted in Fig. 2. But, in fact, in information theory the main
action happens later: a source is producing stuff, and we want that stuff to go
through a, typically smallish, channel. Information theory is mainly about
providing theoretical guarantees of faithfulness in transmission, given how
"wide" the channel is.

We start by providing a measure of the *richness* of the source---a measure,
that is, of how much one needs to know about the source to characterize it in
full. This is called the *entropy* of the source, and can be thought of as the
number of yes/no questions that must be asked in order to fully know the state
of the source (i.e., the message it has produced.) The source, $S$, will be
modeled by random variable which can be in *n* possible different (jointly
exhaustive, mutually exclusive) states, $S_i$, each one of them with a certain
probability, $P_i$. In these circumstances, the entropy of the source, $H(S)$,
is calculated as

$$H(S) = -\sum_n P_i\log(P_i)$$

The logarithm is typically, but not necessarily, in base 2, in which case the
entropy is calculated in *bits*. For a quick example, suppose that the source
is a fair coin that we toss. This can be modeled by random variable with two
states, *heads* and *tails*, such that $P_{heads} = P_{tails} = 0.5$. 

In this case, $H(S) = -\log\frac{1}{2} = 1$ bit, which corresponds to our
intuitive characterization of entropy above: we only need to ask *one* yes/no
question in order to find out the state of our source (i.e., whether the coin
came out heads or tails). Say, "did the coin land tails?". This corresponds to
the 1 bit value for the entropy of the source that we have just calculated.

We can also think of the *rate* of the channel in terms of entropy: we suppose
that the source is doing its thing periodically; say, in our example, the coin
is tossed every 10 seconds. This means that the source produces information at
a rate of .1 bit/s (or 1 bit per 10 seconds.) The channel allows the passage of
a certain number of non-overlapping symbols in the same period of time. For
example, the channel might allow the passage of one out of two possible symbols
every 10 seconds---this, again, corresponds to a .1 bit/s rate. This is enough
to communicate all there is to know about the source: it would suffice to send
one of the symbols when the coin lands heads, and the other when it lands
tails.

Indeed, Shannon's *source coding theorem*, one of the most celebrated early
results in information theory, states that it is possible to transmit through a
channel information coming from a source with an arbitrarily small error (that
is, losslessly) iff the rate of the channel is equal to or larger than the
entropy of the source. If the rate is smaller, lossless transmission is
impossible.

The source coding theorem is all about lossless transmission. This is not
particularly relevant, for our current purposes of illuminating the notion of
representation: representations never are a lossless picture of what the world
looks like when the representation is produced. Consider, for example, animal
alarm calls. Vervet monkeys, for example are typically described as being able
to produce three different, discrete kinds of calls
[@SeyfarthMonkeyresponsesthree1980; @SeyfarthVervetmonkeyalarm1980], that are
typically taken to be associated with the presence of leopards, eagles and
snakes respectively (or predators who are similar to these three.) Obviously,
the entropy of the environment that prompts the production of a call vastly
outstrips the rate of a channel which consists in the production of just one
out of three possible signals. This means, as per the source coding theorem,
that loss in communication is inevitable. Alarm calls are all about *lossy
transmission*.

The way in which information theory deals with lossy transmission is by
defining a *distortion measure* [@CoverElementsInformationTheory2006, p. 304]
that gives a score to a pair composed of a certain original message $M$, and
the decoded version thereof, $\hat{M}$, (see Fig. 1). One common distortion
measure is the *Hamming distortion* which simply adds 1 to the distortion when
the bits in the original and decoded messages (which we can assume to be binary
strings) do not coincide, and 0 otherwise. So, for example, the Hamming
distortion between an original message $M = 010011$ and a decoded message
$\hat{M} = 100010$ is 3, because the first, second, and last bits have been
decoded incorrectly.

The central result in this so-called *rate distortion theory* approach to lossy
transmission is that there is a *rate distortion function*, $R(D)$ which gives
the minimum rate at which any given distortion is achievable (and,
equivalently, gives the minimum achievable distortion at any given rate.)^[In
the limit of distortion zero, this result turns into the source coding
theorem.] The actual mathematical expression of the rate distortion function
does not need to detain us (see @CoverElementsInformationTheory2006, p. 307,
theorem 10.2.1.) What is relevant to us is that the *Blahut-Arimoto* algorithm
[@BlahutComputationchannelcapacity1972; @Arimotoalgorithmcomputingcapacity1972]
allows us to calculate easily the rate distortion function---we will be
presently seeing a few examples.

The main proposal I make in this paper is that representations tend to live in
information processing systems whose rate distortion function has *sweet
spots*: by this I mean points in the rate distortion curve such that the
usefulness of increasing the rate of the channel past those points is much
smaller than before reaching them. Moreover, at least in a number of
paradigmatic cases, representations tend to happen in the vicinity of those
sweet spots. I submit that it is this set of purely information-theoretic
properties that the conditions on representation discussed in section 3 try to
get at.

To get the hang of things let's start by looking into the rate distortion curve
for the fair-coin source we have been using as our running example. We will use
the Hamming distortion as our target distortion measure. Some questions about
this curve can be answered without maths: first, what's the minimum average
distortion achievable when the rate is zero---i.e., when the channel is
perfectly closed? Well, the best the decoder can do, given that nothing is
coming through the channel, is always say, e.g., tails, and hope for the best.
This desperate policy will get things right half of the time---whenever the
coin did land tails. This means that the expected distortion will be 0.5.
Second, what's the rate for which the distortion is zero? We know from the
source coding theorem that this rate is equal to the entropy of the source: 1
bit. We know now the points at which the curve makes contact with the x-axis
(distortion zero) and the y-axis (rate zero). Using the Blahut-Arimoto
algorithm we can draw the rest of the curve, in Fig. 3.

![The rate-distortion function for a coin
toss](/home/manolo/Models/rate_distortion_signaling/bernoulli_rd.pdf){scale=0.3}

Here the blue line is the rate distortion function. As we have already seen, it
interects the x-axis at rate equals 1.0 (which is the entropy of the soruce)
and it intersects the y-axis at 0.5 (which is the lowest average distortion one
can achieve when the channel is closed.) The red line gives the slope of the
blue one. That is, it gives a measure of how steep the blue line is. There is
not much structure to this example: increasing the rate makes the achievable
expected distortion go down, and that's about it. Yet the example has all the
information-theoretic ingredients philosophers have typically cared about:
there is a source, and a signal that carries information about the source. It's
really no wonder that this is deemed insufficient to account for
representational status. 

Let's consider now a more complicated example. Here, the source---the situation
we are trying to gather information about---is composed of two homeostatic
property clusters (see above). They are modeled as two independent Bayes
networks, each with a parent node and four children. Each of the nodes stands
for a property; if the node is *on* it means the property is instantiated; if
it is *off* it means it is not. In the model children nodes replicate noisily
the state of their parent. Thus, e.g., if the parent is *on* (if the
corresponding property is instantiated) each child property will have a .95
chance of being instantiated too; if the parent is *off* the probability for
each children of being instantiated is .05. See Fig. 4.

![Two homeostatic property clusters](graphviz/two_indepndent_bitbits.pdf)

All in all, these Bayes nets behave the way Boydian HPCs are supposed to
behave: "There is a family ... of properties that are contingently clustered in
nature in the sense that they co-occur in an important number of cases."
[@BoydWhatRealismImplies1989, p. 16]. For the rest, I replicate the set-up of
our previous example: the source produces a binary string, with each member of
the string being 1 if the corresponding node is on, 0 if it's off. This message
is encoded, goes through a channel, and is then decoded at the other side. The
target distortion measure is, again, the Hamming distortion. Fig. 5 gives the
rate distortion function for this model.

![A sweet spot in the rate distortion
function](/home/manolo/Models/rate_distortion_signaling/two_essence_kinds_rd_with_majority.pdf)

This curve is very different from the one in Fig. 3 in that there is a clear
distortion "sweet spot"---a dramatic decrease in the usefulness of extra
rate---when the system hits 2 bit/s of rate, signaled by the sudden drop in the
red slope curve. That is, both the statistical structure of the source (i.e.,
the fact that the world of the model is populated with two HPC natural kinds)
and the distortion measure conspire to make it the case that there is, in a
certain principled sense, an optimal level of lossy compression; a way to set
up an encoding-decoding strategy that recover most of what's going on in the
world, even through a very severe, 2 bit bottleneck. I suggest that our
representation-attributing practices gravitate towards this kind of systems.
When we credit a vehicle with representational status, at least in certain
paradigmatic cases, we are responding to the fact that it lives in a rate
distortion curve with sweet spots. 

To see how sweet spots in rate distortion curves and representations are
related, consider what an optimal encoding-decoding strategy would look like.
That is, how should the encoder encode the information coming from the source,
and how should the decoder decode the signal coming from the encoder, so that
the resulting expected distortion between original and decoded message is the
minimum achievable? This point is marked with an x over the blue curve in Fig.
4, and one way for the encoder-decoder arrangement to land there is as follows:

Optimal Encoding Strategy:

:   First divide the incoming message in two halves, one corresponding to
properties $P_1$ through $P_5$; the other corresponding to properties $P_6$
through $P_{10}$.
    
    If there is a majority of 1s in the first half of the original message set
    the first bit to 1. Otherwise set it to 0. Ditto for the second half of the
    original message and the second bit.

Optimal Decoding Strategy:

:   If the first bit in the incoming signal is 1, set the first half of the
decoded message to 11111. Otherwise, set it to 00000. Ditto for the second bit
and the second half of the decoded message.

So, for example, 1110001100 encodes to 10: the first half of the original
message, 11100, has a majority of 1s, and thus results in the first bit of the
encoded signal being 1. The second half, 01100 has a majority of 0s and results
in the second bit of the signal being a 0. 10, in turn, decodes to 1111100000,
as per the optimal decoding strategy.

This encoding-decoding strategy corresponds to the x in Fig. 5. It's the
optimal strategy at the sweet spot. A natural way to interpret what encoder and
decoder are doing here is using the presence or absence of properties in an HPC
as diagnostic of the presence or absence of the underlying natural kind (this
would be the encoding part) and then taking the resulting signals as indicative
of the presence of a paradigmatic instance of the kind, one that has all the
properties in the cluster---this would be the decoding part. HPC kinds being
what they are, frequently the first half of the incoming message will resemble
the paradigmatic presence of the first kind (11111) or its paradigmatic absence
(00000), and the same will happen with the second half and the second kind.
That is why this encoding-decoding strategy works so well. 

In describing this optimal strategy I have helped myself to representational
talk; it has been useful in order to explain how the strategy works, and how
come that behaving in this particular way achieves low distortion at low rates:
it is because each of the two bits in the signal is caused by, and causes,
behavior that is optimally sensitive to the probabilistic structure of each of
the two natural kinds in the model world, respectively. Nothing going on in
this system falls outside the purview of Shannonian information theory---of
information theory *tout court*. Representational talk depends on no
extra-informational fact, and this make it plausible that representations, at
least in cases such as this, doesn't either. What has been relevant is,
first, that *the world and the distortion measure conspire to create a sweet
spot in the rate distortion curve*; and, second, that *the encoding-decoding
strategy operates at (or near) this sweet spot*.

We can now understand better what's lacking in the philosopher of mind's
information-theoretic tookit: it's entirely possible, and computationally
trivial, to calculate, e.g., Skyrm's pointwise mutual information between each
of the possible signals (00, 01, 10 and 11) ahd each possible world state (all
1024 of them, from 0000000000 to 1111111111). It's equally trivial to calculate
the same quantities in the coin toss model, for all world states (the two of
them, heads and tails) and different signaling strategies. It's just as easy to
calculate whether signals carry Shea-style correlational information about this
or that world state, in both the two-natural-kinds and the coin-toss models.

Brian Skyrms claims that "[i]f a signal carries propositional information, that
information can be read off the informational content vector"
[@SkyrmsSignalsEvolutionLearning2010, p. 41.] If by "propositional content" he
means representational content, he is wrong about this. As we saw above his own
gloss on representational content is unable to accommodate misrepresentation
[@BirchPropositionalcontentsignalling2014]. The kind of information-theoretic
formalism that, I have urged, should be used to investigate the nature of
representation, on the other hand, is perfectly able to.

First of all, from the purely rate-distortion-theoretic perspective, it is very
possible for the decoded message not to be equal to the original message in the
relevant respects---that is, it is very possible for the distortion of any
particular original message-decoded message pair to be nonzero. More
importantly, if, as I have suggested, the representational content of, e.g.,
the signal "10" in the two-natural-kinds models is something along the lines of
"the first natural kind is instantiated and the second is not", the production
of this signal is perfectly compatible with the falsity of its content. In
order to evaluate this rigorously we would need to fill in some metaphysical
details, regarding what it takes for a natural kind to be instantiated, but
under many plausible responses to this question, the fact remains that the
signal can be false. Suppose, for example that our theory entails that the
$P_1$ ... $P_5$ kind is instantiated iff its parent property, $P_1$, is
instantiated.^[That is, we adhere to an essentialist metaphysics of kinds.
Whether this would be a faithful description of the Kripke-Putnam approach to
such metaphysics is unclear: here the relation between essence and superficial
properties is noisy and, for example, in the model it's possible (if very
unlikely) for the parent property to be instantiated without any of the
children properties being instantiated as well. For an exploration of the
probabilistic structure of essence kinds, homeostatic property clusters and
other, more exotic options, see [redacted for review]] Because the
instantiation of a majority of properties in the $P_2$ to $P_5$ range is
compatible with the absence of $P_1$ it is equally possible for the encoder to
set the first bit of the signal to 1 in the absence of any member of the first
kind. If we choose as the criterion of presence of a kind member the same as
the one we are using in the optimal encoding strategy (i.e., the presence of a
majority of properties in the kind cluster) then misrepresentation is again
impossible; but this is an artifact of the actual details of the example, not a
limitation of the framework: suppose, for example, that the encoder only has
access to the children nodes (the superficial properties) and not the parent
node. This will be more biologically realistic in a number of cases---e.g.,
when children properties are detectable features such as shape, color or voice,
and the root property is, say, genetic or historical---, and the resulting
encoding-decoding strategy, while not optimal is still very good.^[The optimal
encoding-decoding strategy has an expected distortion of .40, and this
children-only strategy, one of 0.41. The source code that calculates all data
and generates the figures in the paper is published under a free software
license and can be downloaded from [redacted for review]] It is possible for
this encoder-decoder pair to misrepresent the presence of a member of a kind if
the criterion of such presence is the instantiation of a majority of properties
in the cluster.

The account of misrepresentation I have sketched here depends upon the idea
that representational status, and representational content, is granted by the
presence of, and proximity to, a rate-distortion sweet spot. Rate-distortion
analyses do not apply to Skyrms's informational content, or any other of the
ideas described in section 2, which rely on the fragment of the
information-processing pipeline depicted in Fig. 2, and which consequently have
no room for the notion of distortion.

I turn now to showing how the ways to bridge the gap between natural and
non-natural information discussed in ssection 3 can be seen as unwitting
attempts to get at rate-distortion sweet spots.

# Bridging Again

I have suggested above that the status of signals in an information processing
pipeline as representations or not is sensitive to at least two
information-theoretic condition: first an *existence condition* that there be a
sweet spot in the rate distortion curve; second, an *optimality condition* that
the encoding-decoding strategy implemented in the pipeline operates at (or
near) this sweet spot.

Now, what does it take for the existence condition to be met? That is to say,
what circumstances result in sudden drops in the slope of the rate-distortion
curve? We have seen one such family of circumstances: if the pattern in which
properties are instantiated in the source is noisily replicated from property
to property in a cluster then sudden drops will happen: distortion will
decrease sharply with rate up until the point where all the main sources of
variation in instantiation are accounted for, and all that remains is the
residual noise in property instantiations within each cluster. Take a look
again at Figs. 4 and 5: to describe this source we basically need enough rate
to account for the two main sources of variation, $P_1$ and $P_6$. This is not
all there is to the world, because it's possible for the other properties to
(fail to) token independently of their parent, but the unlikeliness of these
departures makes the extra rate comparatively less useful. 

Noisy replication of property instantiations is at the core of the homeostatic
property cluster theory of natural kinds, as we saw above.^[[redacted 1] and
[redacted 2] offer more detailed exploration of the connections of information
theory and HPCs.] This means that, in general, the presence of HPC natural
kinds in a source will create sweet spots. This opens the possibility for
arguing in favor of reference magnetism from information-theoretic premises.
Lewis and Sider (and Artiga, Martínez, and Ryder)  are not pulling a rabbit out
of the hat by insisting that 

A rate distortion curve is defined by just two properties of the
information-processing system: on the one hand, the probabilistic structure of
the source; on the other hand, the target distortion measure.
